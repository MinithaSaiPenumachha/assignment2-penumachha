### SALAR JUNG MUSEUM

I am interested in the historic things. There is a museum located in Hyderabad, India. This museum has lot of sculptures ,textiles, ceramics and many other artefacts. It has the collection of Salar Jung’s property and here we can  find the collection of Mughal emperor’s jade daggers,collection of gold and diamonds, furniture of napoleon and many others.

**History is a gallery of pictures in which there are few originals and many copies**
